# Asymmetric Cross Entropy Loss

Implementation of the **Asymmetric Cross Entropy Loss** for the Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU-Learning) for PyTorch. The method is adapted from the [Asymmetric Loss for Positive-Unlabeled Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9428350?casa_token=uC1-ULWEN20AAAAA:qHDtihKaxMwWtV4t1EYnZyuGca3NaYYlVNfLuoVtsm9D1SgIuDi7lebg02_LcJfAsMA0bB-DghAK) paper [1] - it is not one-to-one implementation.
